# Python Snake Game using OOP and Turtle Graphics

## Overview

Welcome to the Python Snake Game! This project is a classic Snake game implemented using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Turtle graphics package for the graphical user interface (GUI).

This project was developed as part of my 100 days of coding challenge in Python, and this marks my 20th day of the challenge.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: The game is structured using OOP principles, with separate classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard.
- **Smooth Animations**: The game provides real-time updates and smooth animations using the Turtle graphics package.
- **Interactive Interface**: The user-friendly interface with responsive controls ensures an engaging gameplay experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nihilhesara/Snake-Game.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd Snake-Game

3. Running the game
   python main.py

How to Play

• Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
• Eat the food to grow the snake.
• Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
• The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.  

Project structure 

• main.py: The main script to run the game.
• snake.py: Contains the Snake class that manages the snake's behavior.
• food.py: Contains the Food class that manages the food for the snake.
• scoreboard.py: Contains the Scoreboard class that manages the score display.

Acknowledgements
• The Python community for the great resources and support.
• The developers of the Turtle graphics package for providing an excellent tool for creating graphical applications.
